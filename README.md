- The AzurePipelineTasks project implements a command line tool that generates C# code that allows modelling Azure DevOps pipelines and generate the corresponding YAML pipeline definitions from that model. It uses the [azure-pipelines-tasks](https://github.com/Microsoft/azure-pipelines-tasks) as input for the code generation (specifically the task.json definition files in that repo)
- The AzurePipelineAsCode.NET project is the target for the code generation, and is used to package up the generated code into a nuget
- An automated build will run the code generation on a regular basis and publish updated nuget packages automatically, if changes occured
- The Pipeline repository dogfeeds the whole idea to generate the azure-pipelines.yml file used in this repository. The .yml file can be regenerated by running "dotnet run -- ..\azure-pipelines.yml" in the Pipeline folder. The end goal would be to not have the generated .yml file checked in anymore, but generate it on demand during build time, which requires support by Azure DevOps
